# LuaScott

## Introduction

This is a project, to produce an interpreter for the Scott Adams Adventure International text adventure game interpreter. It's using Lua for easy portability and integration.

## Current state

It's currently not working at all. Some of the things needed to make this complete are the following:

* Action processing  
  * Command execution
  * "Cont" flag handling
* User interface layer
* Savegame functionality
* Game patching functionality (for "modernizing" some aspects)

## Actions, conditions and commands

The programmable game logic is divided into "actions", which contain 5 "condition" instructions and 4 "command" instructions. The purpose of conditions, is to read data in the game world and evaluate if the action's command instructions should execute. The purpose of the actions is to manipulate data in the game world.

Type | Symbol | Description | Reads resource | Writes resource
---- | ------ | ----------- | -------------- | ---------------
Condition | PAR | Passes a number to the commands | argument | queue
Condition | HAS | True if holding the object | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | IN/W | True if in same room as object (not holding it) | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | AVL | True if in same room or holding object | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | IN | True if in room | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | -IN/W | True if holding object or if object is in another room | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | -HAVE | True if not holding object | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | -IN | True if not in room | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | BIT | True if bit flag set | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | -BIT | True if bit flag cleared | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | ANY | True if holding any objects | | keep_processing_flag
Condition | -ANY | True if not holding any objects | | keep_processing_flag
Condition | -AVL | True if object in another room | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | -RM0 | True if object not in room zero | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | RM0 | True if object in room zero | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | CT<= | True if counter less than or equal to number | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | CT> | True if counter greater than number | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | ORIG | True if object in original starting room | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | -ORIG | True if object not in original starting room | argument | keep_processing_flag
Condition | CT= | True if counter equal to number | argument | keep_processing_flag
