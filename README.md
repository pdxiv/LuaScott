# LuaScott
## Introduction
This is a project, to produce an interpreter for the Scott Adams Adventure Interational text adventure game engine. It's using Lua for easy portability and integration.
## Current state
It's currently not working at all. Some of the things needed to make this complete are the following:
* Action processing
  * Condition evaluation
  * Command execution
  * "Cont" flag handling
* User interface layer
* Savegame functionality
